1) Write a java program to take array length as input from user and create 
an integer array . Create an integer array and store elements into the array 
by taking elements as input from keyboard.Before Swapping print the 
contents of array Ask user to enter 2 indexes . Swap the the values of 2 indexes
After swapping print the contents of array.

Sample input output

Before swapping
Arr--> 10 20 30 40 50
After Swapping
Arr-->10 30 20 40 50

2) Write a java program to take array length as input from user and create an 
integer array. Take elements from user and  store elements into the array 
Call a method printArray present in PrintArray class which will print the 
array in forward direction and in reverse direction.

3) Check whether an element is present in an array or not (linear search):
Problem: We're given an array of numbers and a specific number called the 
"target." Our task is to determine whether this target number is present within 
our array or not.

Approach: Here's a simple way we could solve this problem. We'll start at the
 beginning of our array and check each element one by one to see if it's the 
 same as our target number. This process is known as linear search - think of 
 it as taking a magnifying glass and going down the line of our array, 
 examining each number closely. If we find a match, we can immediately say that 
 the target is indeed present in the array. If we get to the end of the array 
 without finding the target, then it's safe to say the target is not present 
 in the array.
 

public class ArraySearch 
{
 public static void main(String[] args) 
{
//Complete code here
}
}
Class Search
{
Public boolean isPresent(int arr[],int target)
{
//Complete code here
}
}

====================================================================================

4) Copy all elements of one array into another array:
Problem: We're given an array, and we need to create a new array that contains 
all the elements of the original array.

Approach: We will iterate through the given array and copy each element to the 
new array at the same index. The new array will be of the same size as the 
original array.

Boiler Plate Code
Class CopyArray
{
//main method and rest of the code.

}
